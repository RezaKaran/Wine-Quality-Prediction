![Analysis](https://miro.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZfGz-BAu7GkLXkcZgEWQ3Q.jpeg)


## About
Wine quality refers to the factors that go into producing a wine, as well as the indicators or characteristics that tell you if the wine is of high quality.In this project we want Artificial intelligence predict the quality of wine.



## First things first : Get to know the dataset

IN this step we load the dataset which has been cleaned and see the different factors in it. 

## Second: Modeling

In this step we use some models like Linear regression and random forest to predict the model

## Third: Pytorch

In this step we want to use neural networks to see the prediction rate with different factors.


## Why

Finding the best way that the model train itself and predict 


## Usage

To install this project, you need to have Python3 and import necessary libraries like Pandas,matplotlib,
 
The dataset wine.csv is attached to the project
