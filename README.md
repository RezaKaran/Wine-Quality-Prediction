![Analysis](https://miro.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZfGz-BAu7GkLXkcZgEWQ3Q.jpeg)


## About
Wine quality refers to the factors that go into producing a wine, as well as the indicators or characteristics that tell you if the wine is of high quality.In this project I want Artificial intelligence predict the quality of wine.



## First things first : Get to know the dataset

In this step I load the dataset which has been cleaned and see the different factors in it. 


## Second: Pytorch

In this step we want to use neural networks to see the prediction rate with different factors.


## Why

Finding the best way that the model train itself and predict 


## Usage

To install this project, you need to have Python3 and import necessary libraries like Pandas,matplotlib and pytorch 
 
The dataset wine.csv is attached to the project

## Result
The best result is:
Learning Rate: 0.001  Epoch: 550   Train Loss: 1.055   Train Accuracy: 55.25    Test Loss: 1.092   Test Accuracy: 52.31
